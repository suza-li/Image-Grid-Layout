# Objective of Project
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with CSS Grid, allowing creation of complex layouts with ease.

# Challenges
The challenge of this project was learning more about the grid. I had some trouble with the height scaling of the images in the grid. I researched on how to fix the issue and the result was to do calculations of the height with the padding.
